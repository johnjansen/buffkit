## SSE Reconnection with State Recovery

### Complex Problem Characteristics
1. **State Management Complexity**: Managing client state across disconnections requires careful synchronization between multiple components (broker, session manager, clients)
2. **Race Conditions**: Multiple goroutines accessing shared state necessitates proper mutex usage and careful ordering of operations
3. **Memory Management**: Ring buffers provide bounded memory usage but require careful size tuning based on expected usage patterns
4. **Identity Persistence**: Using cookies + headers provides redundancy for session ID transmission across different client types

### Architectural Decisions That Worked

#### Separation of Concerns
- **Session Manager**: Handles persistent state, cleanup, and validation
- **Broker**: Manages active connections and message routing
- **Handler**: Deals with HTTP/SSE protocol specifics
- This separation makes each component testable and maintainable

#### Ring Buffer for Event Storage
- Provides automatic oldest-event eviction when full
- Bounded memory usage prevents runaway memory consumption
- Simple to implement and reason about
- Trade-off: May lose events during extended disconnections

#### Dual-Channel Communication
- Using both cookies and headers for session ID allows flexibility
- Cookies work well for browsers
- Headers work for programmatic clients
- Fallback mechanism increases robustness

### Implementation Insights

#### Goroutine Lifecycle Management
- Always use WaitGroups for graceful shutdown
- Cleanup goroutines should have configurable intervals
- Stop channels should be buffered to prevent blocking

#### Event Replay Strategy
- Mark replayed events with metadata rather than modifying content
- Send replay markers (start/end) to help clients manage state
- Small delays between replayed events prevent overwhelming clients
- Original timestamps should be preserved for event ordering

#### Session Validation
- Simply checking "is session active" prevents basic hijacking
- More sophisticated validation (IP, user agent) adds security but may break legitimate reconnections
- Balance between security and usability is context-dependent

### Testing Challenges

#### Timing Issues
- SSE connections are inherently asynchronous
- Tests need appropriate sleeps/waits for events to propagate
- Consider using channels or callbacks for synchronization in tests

#### Connection Management
- httptest.Server provides good isolation for tests
- Must properly close connections to avoid resource leaks
- Mock clients need careful lifecycle management

#### Event Parsing
- SSE format parsing in tests can be simplified but must handle edge cases
- Line-based parsing works but needs buffering for multi-line data

### Performance Considerations

#### Buffer Sizing
- 1000 events per session is reasonable for most applications
- Consider memory usage: 1000 clients × 1000 events × event size
- Make buffer size configurable based on deployment constraints

#### Cleanup Intervals
- 10-second cleanup interval balances resource usage with responsiveness
- Shorter intervals increase CPU usage
- Longer intervals may delay memory reclamation

#### Connection Timeouts
- 5-second timeout for event delivery prevents zombie connections
- 30-second buffer TTL handles typical network interruptions
- Both should be configurable based on use case

### Security Learnings

#### Session Management
- Cryptographically secure session IDs prevent guessing
- HttpOnly cookies prevent XSS attacks
- SameSite=Strict prevents CSRF for modern browsers
- Session validation must balance security with usability

#### Resource Limits
- Buffer size limits prevent memory exhaustion attacks
- Connection limits per session prevent resource abuse
- Rate limiting (not yet implemented) would prevent reconnection storms

### BDD Testing Insights

#### Scenario Complexity
- Complex scenarios require more setup code
- Helper functions (like readEvents) reduce duplication
- Table-driven tests would further improve maintainability

#### State Management in Tests
- Test suites need careful state isolation
- Reset functions must be comprehensive
- Concurrent access requires proper synchronization

#### Feature File Design
- Comprehensive scenarios help think through edge cases
- Natural language helps communicate intent
- Some scenarios may be too complex for simple step definitions

### Production Readiness Gaps

#### Monitoring
- Need metrics for buffer usage, reconnection rates, memory usage
- Structured logging would improve debugging
- Distributed tracing would help in microservice environments

#### Scalability
- Current in-memory storage won't work for multiple servers
- Redis-based session storage would enable horizontal scaling
- Event sourcing could provide better event persistence

#### Resilience
- Circuit breakers for failing clients would prevent cascade failures
- Exponential backoff for reconnections would prevent thundering herd
- Health checks would enable proper load balancer integration

### Code Quality Observations

#### Type Safety
- Go's type system helps catch many errors at compile time
- Interface definitions would improve testability
- Generic types (Go 1.18+) could reduce code duplication

#### Error Handling
- Errors should be wrapped with context
- Silent failures in goroutines are dangerous
- Proper error propagation improves debuggability

#### Concurrency Patterns
- Channels for communication between goroutines works well
- Mutexes for shared state protection is necessary but adds complexity
- Consider alternatives like sync.Map for specific use cases

### Next Steps for Improvement
