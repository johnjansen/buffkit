# TODO: Achieve 100% BDD Coverage for v0.1 Spec

## Overview
**Current Code Coverage:** ~7.4% overall (some packages up to 75%)
**Feature Files:** Aligned with spec after removing 77 out-of-scope scenarios
**New Goal:** 100% BDD coverage of actual PLAN.md specification
**Priority:** Systematic coverage of all packages with proper BDD scenarios

## BDD Coverage Plan Summary
- **Created 5 new feature files:** mail.feature, jobs.feature, security.feature, import_maps.feature, migrations.feature
- **Total new scenarios needed:** ~150 scenarios across all packages
- **Estimated effort:** 3 weeks to achieve 80-90% coverage
- **See:** `.agent/bdd-coverage-plan.md` for complete details

## Package Coverage Status
- 🔴 **auth/** - 0% coverage - Need: login, logout, session, password hashing scenarios
- 🔴 **mail/** - 0% coverage - Need: SMTP, dev sender, preview endpoint scenarios  
- 🔴 **jobs/** - 0% coverage - Need: Asynq runtime, job processing, worker scenarios
- 🔴 **secure/** - 0% coverage - Need: headers, CSRF, rate limiting scenarios
- 🔴 **components/** - 0% coverage - Need: registry, expansion, middleware scenarios
- 🟡 **importmap/** - 22.6% coverage - Need: pin/unpin, vendoring, HTML generation scenarios
- 🟡 **ssr/** - 23.9% coverage - Need: render partial, SSE broadcast scenarios
- 🟡 **sse/** - 0% coverage - Need: broker, heartbeat, client management scenarios
- 🟢 **migrations/** - 75.7% coverage - Need: rollback, status, multi-dialect scenarios
- 🟡 **buffkit.go** - 7.4% coverage - Need: wiring, configuration, shutdown scenarios

### Latest Progress (Updated)

- [ ] `I run "grift buffkit:worker 10" with timeout 2 seconds` - Requires Redis
- [ ] `I run "grift buffkit:scheduler" with timeout 2 seconds` - Requires Redis

## 2. ✅ RESOLVED: TestAllFeatures Hanging Issue

Fixed by implementing split test suites architecture:
- [x] Investigated hanging cause - resource contention during simultaneous initialization
- [x] Created focused test suites (TestCoreFeatures, TestAuthenticationFeatures, etc.)
- [x] Implemented TestAllFeaturesSequential for full coverage
- [x] Updated CI/CD to use sequential runner
- [x] Deprecated problematic TestAllFeatures function

## 3. ✅ RESOLVED: Component Rendering in Tests

Fixed component expansion in test framework:
- [x] Updated SharedContext to use component registry for HTML rendering
- [x] Fixed HTML parsing issues in component expansion
- [x] Component registry system implemented
- [x] Component expansion middleware working

## 4. Component Registry System (COMPLETE)

### ✅ What's Actually Implemented
The component system provides:
- **Registry for custom components** - Apps can register their own components
- **HTML expansion middleware** - Replaces custom tags with rendered HTML
- **Attribute and slot support** - Components receive attributes and nested content
- **No pre-built components** - Apps define what they need

### ❌ Test Issues to Fix
The `components.feature` file incorrectly tests specific components (button, card, modal, etc.) 
instead of testing the registry infrastructure. These tests should be rewritten to:
1. Test registering a custom component
2. Test the expansion middleware
3. Test attribute passing
4. Test slot content distribution
5. NOT test specific component implementations

The feature file needs to be rewritten to test the infrastructure, not imaginary components.

   - Document that feature tests are temporarily disabled

## Other
1. templates should be in plush files, not embedded in go code
2. each domain within the package should have its own template directory, each domain should (where possible) be discrete and self-contained, while following a common pattern and adhering to a consistent naming convention. Additionally, each domain should have a clear and concise README file that explains its purpose and usage.
