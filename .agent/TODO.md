- [x] ALL environment variable patterns - both quote styles
- [x] ALL command execution patterns - with timeouts
- [x] ALL HTML rendering patterns - including tag-specific formats
- [x] Component attribute checks: class, data-*, aria-*, type, name, hx-*
- [x] SSE event patterns: event type, event data, client connections
- [x] Authentication patterns: login, sessions, account locking, remember me
- [x] Email/mail patterns: SMTP sending, dev mode handling
- [x] HTTP patterns: GET/POST, status codes, content types
