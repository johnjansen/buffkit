# Buffkit BDD Implementation Status

## Summary
**Date:** 2024

### Overall Statistics
- **Total Step Definitions:** 305
- **Implemented Step Definitions:** 305 (100%)
- **Unimplemented Step Definitions:** 0 (0%)
- **Feature Steps:** 575
- **Undefined Steps:** 324 (56% of feature steps lack definitions)

## Key Findings

### ✅ Good News
- **All registered step definitions are fully implemented** - no "panic('not yet implemented')" found
- The codebase has moved past stub implementations
- 305 working step definitions provide substantial test coverage

### ⚠️ Areas Needing Attention
- **324 undefined steps** - These are steps written in feature files but lacking corresponding step definitions
- This represents 56% of all feature steps that cannot be executed

## Undefined Step Categories

### 1. CLI/Grift Tasks (NEW - Not Yet Implemented)
- Database migration commands
- Worker process management
- Scheduler operations
- Redis connection handling
- Environment variable configuration
- These need the new CLI testing framework we just created

### 2. SSE Reconnection Features (@skip tags)
Most SSE reconnection features are marked with @skip:
- Session persistence
- Buffer management
- Multi-client scenarios
- Load balancing across servers
- Memory management
- Security features

### 3. Component System
Missing definitions for:
- Advanced component rendering
- ARIA accessibility attributes
- Component composition
- Icon and avatar components
- Tab components
- Progress bars

### 4. Authentication Enhanced
Missing definitions for:
- Session management UI
- Remember me functionality
- Password change tracking
- Account locking
- Multi-device sessions

### 5. Development Mode
Missing definitions for:
- Hot reload functionality
- Asset serving optimization
- Diagnostic endpoints
- Email preview in dev mode

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Priority
1. **Implement CLI task step definitions** using the new `CLIContext` we created
2. **Remove or implement @skip scenarios** in SSE reconnection
3. **Consolidate duplicate patterns** - many undefined steps are variations of the same pattern

### Pattern Consolidation Opportunities
Many undefined steps could be handled by regex patterns:
- `the output should contain "([^"]*)"` - handles 40+ undefined steps
- `I render HTML containing '([^']*)'` - handles 20+ undefined steps
- `I set environment variable "([^"]*)" to "([^"]*)"` - handles multiple env var steps

### Testing Strategy Improvements
1. **Use the new CLI testing framework** for all grift task testing
2. **Consider using testcontainers** for Redis/database integration tests
3. **Implement proper cleanup** in all test scenarios
4. **Add timeout handling** for long-running operations

## File Structure Recommendations

### Current Test Files
- `features/main_test.go` - Main test runner
- `features/steps_test.go` - Core step definitions
- `features/cli_context_test.go` - NEW: CLI testing framework
- Various feature-specific `*_test.go` files

### Proposed Additions
- `features/cli_steps_test.go` - Implement CLI-specific steps
- `features/sse_reconnection_steps_test.go` - Implement SSE reconnection steps
- `features/component_advanced_steps_test.go` - Advanced component testing

## Next Steps

1. **Run the actual tests** to see which undefined steps cause failures:
   ```bash
   go test ./features/... -v -tags=integration
   ```

2. **Prioritize by usage frequency** - Some undefined steps appear in multiple scenarios

3. **Consider feature pruning** - Some features might be over-specified for v0.1-alpha

4. **Implement step definitions in batches**:
   - Batch 1: CLI/Grift tasks (using new CLIContext)
   - Batch 2: Core component rendering
   - Batch 3: Authentication enhancements
   - Batch 4: SSE reconnection (or defer to v0.2)

## Conclusion

While we have **zero unimplemented step definitions**, we have significant work to do on **undefined steps**. The good news is that the implementation framework is solid - we just need to connect more feature specifications to actual test code.

The introduction of the CLI testing framework (`CLIContext`) provides the foundation for testing the grift tasks, which represent a significant portion of the undefined steps.

**Recommendation:** Focus on implementing the CLI task steps first, as they test critical functionality and we now have the proper framework in place.
