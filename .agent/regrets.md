# Buffkit Implementation Regrets

## Architectural Regrets

### 1. Renderer Pattern Confusion
- **Regret**: Created multiple renderer structs (authRenderer, mailRenderer, etc.) in different packages
- **Should have**: Created a single shared renderer in a common package
- **Impact**: Code duplication and confusion about Buffalo's render interface

### 2. Not Starting with Interfaces First
- **Regret**: Jumped into implementation before clearly defining all interfaces
- **Should have**: Defined all interfaces in a single `interfaces.go` file first
- **Impact**: Had to refactor multiple times as we discovered interface requirements

### 3. Mixing Concerns in Main Package
- **Regret**: Put too much logic in the main `buffkit.go` file
- **Should have**: Created a `wire/` package for the wiring logic
- **Impact**: Main package is doing too much, harder to test

## Technical Regrets

### 1. Buffalo Version Assumptions
- **Regret**: Started with v0.18.14 which doesn't exist
- **Should have**: Checked available versions first or used latest tag
- **Impact**: Wasted time debugging version issues

### 2. Not Understanding Buffalo's Render Interface
- **Regret**: Implemented wrong signature for Render method multiple times
- **Should have**: Studied Buffalo's render.Renderer interface first
- **Impact**: Multiple compilation failures and rewrites

### 3. HTML Component Parsing Stub
- **Regret**: Used golang.org/x/net/html but didn't fully implement parsing
- **Should have**: Either fully implemented or used simpler string replacement for POC
- **Impact**: Complex code that doesn't actually work yet

## Package Design Regrets

### 1. Circular Dependency Potential
- **Regret**: Didn't plan package dependencies carefully
- **Should have**: Drew dependency graph first
- **Impact**: Risk of circular imports as features interconnect

### 2. Global State Management
- **Regret**: Using global variables for stores (auth, mail)
- **Should have**: Used dependency injection consistently
- **Impact**: Makes testing harder, less flexible

### 3. Missing Core Package
- **Regret**: No central `core/` package for shared types
- **Should have**: Created core package with common types/interfaces
- **Impact**: Duplication and unclear ownership of shared concepts

## Implementation Regrets

### 1. SSE Broker Complexity
- **Regret**: Over-engineered the SSE broker for a stub
- **Should have**: Started with simplest possible implementation
- **Impact**: Complex code that might not match real needs

### 2. Component System Ambition
- **Regret**: Tried to build full HTML parsing for components
- **Should have**: Started with regex or template-based approach
- **Impact**: Non-functional component system in the stub

### 3. Security Middleware Stub Quality
- **Regret**: Half-implemented security features (broken CSRF, etc.)
- **Should have**: Either fully implemented or clearly marked as TODO
- **Impact**: Dangerous if someone uses the stub thinking it's secure

## Testing Regrets

### 1. No Tests Written
- **Regret**: Didn't write any tests alongside the implementation
- **Should have**: Used TDD, at least for core functionality
- **Impact**: No confidence in what actually works

### 2. Harness as Afterthought
- **Regret**: Built harness after main implementation
- **Should have**: Built harness first to drive design
- **Impact**: Discovered integration issues late

### 3. No Benchmarks
- **Regret**: No performance baselines established
- **Should have**: Added basic benchmarks for critical paths
- **Impact**: No idea about performance characteristics

## Documentation Regrets

### 1. Inline Documentation
- **Regret**: Sparse godoc comments
- **Should have**: Documented every public type and method
- **Impact**: Unclear API contracts

### 2. Examples Missing
- **Regret**: No example code in documentation
- **Should have**: Added runnable examples
- **Impact**: Harder for users to understand usage

### 3. Migration Path Unclear
- **Regret**: Didn't document how to migrate from Rails/Loco
- **Should have**: Created migration guide early
- **Impact**: Missing key selling point documentation

## Process Regrets

### 1. Not Following the Plan
- **Regret**: Deviated from PLAN.md structure in places
- **Should have**: Used PLAN.md as checklist
- **Impact**: Missing features, inconsistent implementation

### 2. All-at-Once Approach
- **Regret**: Tried to stub everything simultaneously
- **Should have**: Completed one package fully before moving on
- **Impact**: Everything half-done, nothing fully working

### 3. Not Using Feature Branches
- **Regret**: Everything in one commit/branch
- **Should have**: One branch per package/feature
- **Impact**: Hard to review, revert, or iterate

## Missing Critical Features

### 1. Template System
- **Regret**: No actual template rendering
- **Should have**: Integrated Plush templates properly
- **Impact**: Can't actually render views

### 2. Asset Pipeline
- **Regret**: No asset handling at all
- **Should have**: At least served static files
- **Impact**: No CSS/JS in harness

### 3. Database Migrations
- **Regret**: Migration runner is completely stubbed
- **Should have**: Implemented basic migration running
- **Impact**: Can't actually use the database features

## Things I Regret Not Doing

### 1. Research First
- Should have studied Buffalo's internals more
- Should have looked at similar projects (Lucky, Phoenix)
- Should have understood Go's embed package better

### 2. Incremental Delivery
- Should have made it work with one feature first
- Should have had a working demo earlier
- Should have gotten feedback sooner

### 3. Better Error Handling
- Should have consistent error types
- Should have better error messages
- Should have panic recovery in middleware

## Things I Don't Regret

### 1. Starting Simple
- Good to have a working harness
- Good to discover integration issues early
- Good to have something that compiles

### 2. Comprehensive Planning
- PLAN.md is solid guide
- Clear vision helped even when implementation struggled
- Good documentation of intent

### 3. Learning Experience
- Learned a lot about Buffalo's internals
- Discovered interface design challenges
- Better understanding of the problem space
